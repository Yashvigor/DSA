1. Definition of Sorting
Sorting is the process of arranging data in a particular order (ascending or descending).

🔹 2. Types of Sorting Based on Data Location
✅ Internal Sort
All elements are present in the main memory during sorting.

Suitable for small datasets that fit entirely in RAM.

Example: Sorting an array of 10 integers stored in memory.

✅ External Sort
Some data is stored in secondary memory (like hard disks or external devices).

Used when data is too large to fit in main memory.

Example: Sorting a huge database file stored on disk.

🔹 3. In-place Sort
The algorithm sorts data by transforming the input within the same memory space.

It does not use extra memory or minimal extra space.

We convert the input to the output in-place.

Example: Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort

🔹 4. Stable Sort
A sorting algorithm is stable if it maintains the relative order of equal elements.
 "First come, first serve" — The earlier element stays first if two elements are equal.
Example:
Input:
[(2, a), (3, b), (5, c), (5, d), (8, e)]

Here, two elements have value 5: (5, c) and (5, d)

After Stable Sort:
[(2, a), (3, b), (5, c), (5, d), (8, e)] ✅ → relative order maintained.

After Unstable Sort:
[(2, a), (3, b), (5, d), (5, c), (8, e)] ❌ → order changed.
